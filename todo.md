now
* bypass feedback not displaying in rig_ui.py
* CRITICAL: client can't resolve diverence between once who triggered the structural change, and reacts on events created by itself! 
* structural changes should call Client.reset and rebuild board from current stored rig state
* can we load/save rig state from/to file

future
* proxy rig state for external devices like esp32/rp2040 via websocket or kinda
* can we support midi routing, how?
